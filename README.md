I got the idea for this project while watching Theo's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLvIoi2s1zY) about how he built [T3Chat](https://t3.chat/), the fastest AI chat, in just 5 days. I was truly inspired by the idea of building a local-first app that feels so smooth and responsive. That's when I discovered an amazing experimental project called [Zero](https://zero.rocicorp.dev/), which makes it possible to build very fast, local-first apps in a matter of days. I don't have any examples of my project to share yet, because I only started building it a few days ago.

But I've already [planned out](https://almondine-chickadee-23a.notion.site/FastThings-198b83fbd4d980c88875d907b5728e82) how it's going to work and make some design in Figma.
